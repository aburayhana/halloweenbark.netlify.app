recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Cream cheese"
- "150 grams Kabocha squash"
- "60 grams Sugar"
- "2 Eggs"
- "3 tbsp Cake flour"
- "200 ml Heavy cream"
- "1 tbsp Lemon juice"
- "1 tbsp Rum"
- "20 grams Butter"
- "1 Chocolate chips"
- "12 Plain cookies or biscuits"
- "50 grams Butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring the cream cheese to room temperature. In a plastic bag, smash the ★ cookies finely with a rolling pin. Microwave the ★ butter."
- "In a bowl, mix the crushed cookies and melted butter. Line a tart pan with parchment paper, spread out the cookie mixture and press down over plastic wrap."
- "When the crust is evenly spread out and pressed, chill in the refrigerator. If you have any cookie mixture left over, chill in a heatproof container."
- "Cut the de-seeded kabocha into bite sized pieces, wrap with plastic wrap and microwave until soft. Remove the skin and pass the rest through a strainer to puree it."
- "Cut out the Jack-O&#39;-Lantern face with the kabocha squash peel. Cut the peel into rectangular strips first before making triangles and squares."
- "In a bowl, whip the softened cream cheese until smooth, and sift in the sugar while mixing constantly."
- "Beat the eggs and add to the cheese mixture little by little. Add the pureed kabocha squash from Step 4 and mix well. Add cake flour and mix again."
- "Add the cream, lemon juice, and rum, in that order. Add melted butter at the end. Preheat the oven to 360F/180C."
- "Take the tart pan with the cookie crust out of the refrigerator. Scatter chocolate chips (if you add too many, the cake will lose its kabocha squash flavor)."
- "Pour the cheesecake batter. Carefully place the Jack-O&#39;-Lantern facial features from Step 5 on the surface, keeping in mind that you will be cutting the cake into 8 pieces."
- "Bake for 45 minutes. When a bamboo skewer poked in the middle comes out clean, it&#39;s done. Cool, and refrigerate overnight."
- "When it&#39;s completely chilled and firm, take it carefully out of the pan and slice with a warm knife (wipe off the blade after every cut for clean cuts)."
