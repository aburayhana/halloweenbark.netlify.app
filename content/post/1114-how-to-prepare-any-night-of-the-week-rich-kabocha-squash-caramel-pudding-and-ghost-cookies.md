recipeinstructions:
- "Make the caramel sauce. Seeand make in advance."
- "Cut up the kabocha squash  and remove the peel, seeds and fibrous insides. Run water over the pieces, put in a microwave-safe container and cover with plastic wrap. Microwave until tender."
- "In a kettle, bring the water that will be used to steam the puddings to a boil. (About 1.5 l)"
- "Make the pudding mix. Put all the ingredients except for the caramel sauce in a food processor or blender, and blend until smooth."
- "Strain through a strainer or a fine mesh sieve."
- "The pudding mixture tends to settle on the bottom, so sieve through the nitty remians with a spatula."
- "Distribute the pudding mix in the molds."
- "If you are going to top the puddings with decorations later, put about 1 tablespoon of caramel in each mold before pouring in the pudding mix."
- "Cover each mold with aluminium foil and put into a large pot. Pour boiling water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the molds."

- "Peel them off the parchment paper or sheet and cool. Draw on faces with the piping chocolate."
- "These cookies melt with a swoosh in your mouth. Just decorate them as you like."
- "The cookies are sensitive to humidity, so if you&#39;re not going to use them right away store them in an airtight container."
- "This is a kabocha squash pudding Mont Blanc. I added kabocha squash cream on top of this pudding. See."
- "FYI: 15cm pan in a steamer for 30-40 minutes. To make the caramel: 50 ml sugar to 25 ml water."
