Gooey s&#39;mores bars filled with a graham cracker crust and loaded with chocolate chips, marshmallows and chocolate candy bar pieces. It&#39;s not summer time without some sort of s&#39;mores dessert. While I love the traditional campfire version, it&#39;s also fun to make variations like these delicious s&#39;mores bars. Reworked the Fame &amp; Reputation cheat so that you can now directly choose from a list of all levels, instead of having to manually enter a number. Fixed using the aspiration cheat on certain aspirations could corrupt the save data and the game would no longer save.
