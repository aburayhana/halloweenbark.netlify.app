So we MUST use silky cream cheese frosting to garnish this perfect pumpkin cake. This pumpkin earthquake cake cracks and sinks throughout the top to reveal a yummy cheesecake filling. So easy to make starting out with a boxed cake mix, yet everyone will think it took hours to make. Make no mistake, this cake is CAKE, not a heavy, dense quick bread simply baked in a cake pan. I liked that - it was nice to have a pumpkin cake where the flavor of the pumpkin was so bold and not hidden underneath tons of spices.
