- "To make the kabocha squash bread: Put flour for making the hot-water-kneaded dough in boiling water (it must be boiling temperature), and use a spoon to mix. Once it forms a dough, lightly shape into a ball."
- "Add a pinch of sugar (not listed) in lukewarm water, sprinkle in the yeast, then stir it until the yeast dissolves."
- "In a large bowl, add the flour, sugar, salt (at a good distance from the sugar), butter, and the hot-water-kneaded dough. Pour the dissolved yeast over the sugar mixture, and mix the flour and hot-water-kneaded dough until the consistency is even."

- "Using your finger, press the center of the dough balls. With a knife, make 6 cuts into the dough from the top down to the sides, until you can slightly see the yellow dough underneath."
- "Place on a baking sheet, spritz water, and let rise for a second time (2nd proof) or 30 minutes. Once it&#39;s finished rising, the yellow dough should be more visible."
- "Preheat the oven to 360°F/180°C. Brush the surface of each ball with a beaten egg (not listed). Bake in oven for about 15 minutes, then they&#39;re ready to serve."
- "If you spread melted butter over the tops of the rolls when they&#39;re finished baking, they&#39;ll become shiny."
