- "Add water to the remaining icing to soften."
- "Pipe in the softened icing inside the outlines to fill them in. Wait until the icing has dried thoroughly."
- "Mix the black food coloring in the icing. Add a tiny bit of water to the icing, so that&#39;s it&#39;s a consistency that&#39;s easy to draw with."
- "Draw the faces on, with the piping bag held perpendicular to the cookie surface."
- "Apply the decorations:"
- "Stick on the decorations before the icing dries."
