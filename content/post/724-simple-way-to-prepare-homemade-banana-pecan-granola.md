Make sure the dried fruit do not stick together in big batches. In another bowl, combine canola oil, mashed banana and vanilla extract. This recipe combines everything we love in banana bread—its mellow flavor, gentle spice, and nutty crunch—into a tender yet crisp granola that&#39;s loaded with dried fruits, whole grains, crunchy seeds, and macadamia nuts. This is my all time favourite granola. It&#39;s got minimal ingredients, is super clumpy and has a light banana taste!
