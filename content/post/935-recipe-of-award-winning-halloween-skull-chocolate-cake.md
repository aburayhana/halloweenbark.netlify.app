recipeingredient:
- "100 g dark chocolate bar"
- "250 ml water just over a cup"
- "3 eggs"
- "250 g brown sugar"
- "125 g butter or margarine"
- "150 g pastry flour or cake flour"
- "25 g bitter cocoa powder"
- "1 tsp baking powder I use ROYAL"
- " For decoration"
- " Powdered sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 160°C/320°F."
- "Break up the chocolate and heat in a sauce pan with the water over low heat so it melts slowly (important!). Watch the chocolate so it doesn’t burn, stir constantly and don’t let the water boil. When you see it’s almost melted, remove from heat and let the remaining heat in pan finish the melting. Now you have the chocolate soup. Set aside for now."
- "In a bowl or mixer, add the butter (should be soft) with the sugar and mix well. Then mix in one egg at a time."
- "When you have added the last egg into the mixture, it should be crumbly."
- "Finally mix the flour with the baking powder and cocoa powder and sift to get rid of the lumps. Add it to the butter and egg mixture and mix. Lastly pour in the chocolate “soup” from earlier and stir in a circular motion until all ingredients are well incorporated."
- "Line a cake mold with baking paper and pour the batter in."
- "Bake for about 50 minutes. The exact time depends on your oven so start checking after 40 minutes. You’ll know when it’s almost ready because your house will begin to smell like chocolate :)"
- "To check if it’s ready, poke with a knife - if it comes out dry it’s good to go."
- "Let the cake cool completely. This is very important because the sugar will melt if it is not completely cool."
- "Remove the cake from the mold and place on a plate with a paper lace doily."
- "Cut a skull pattern out of paper (or other halloween shape) and place on the cake. Using a fine sieve or colander, sprinkle with the powdered sugar."
