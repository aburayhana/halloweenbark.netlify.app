recipeingredient:
- " Your favourite 2 x 8 cake batter"
- "2 7x 3 bundt tins"
- "350 g icing  powdered sugar"
- "150 g gold foil Stork margarine block"
- " orange gel food dye or red  yellow"
- " black piping icing"
- "500 g white ready roll fondant icing"
- " Sweets to fill the cake  I use Haribo gummies jelly beans etc"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to gas 4 / 180C / 350F and grease &amp; flour the bundt tins well"
- "Divide the cake batter between each tin. Fill them up to 3/4 full only. I used my entire free-from Coconut Victoria Sponge recipe batter here which normally fills 2 x 9&#34; rounds. A cake containing egg will rise higher"
- "Bake for 25 - 30 minutes for a plain sponge cake. A heavy cake or fruit cake will need up to an hour to bake. Test with a cocktail stick to make sure they&#39;re cooked through. The cakes should have pulled in from the sides of the tin when done and be firm to the touch"
- "Let stand for 15 minutes in the tins"
- "Run a knife gently around each side of the tins then invert the cakes onto a wire rack to cool completely. If the cake won&#39;t come out, soak a tea towel in hot water, wring it out and let the cake tin stand on top of it for 10 minutes. It should release easily then"
- "Cream the Stork and icing sugar together, adding a touch of orange gel food dye to make it a nice pumpkin colour. You won&#39;t need all of the buttercream but better to have too much! It&#39;ll keep fine in a container in the fridge for another day"
- "Sandwich the 2 cakes together with a layer of the buttercream. The bottom cake should be rounded end down and the top cake rounded end up"
- "Now cover the rest of the cake with the remaining buttercream and skim it smooth"
- "Colour the fondant ready roll icing in the same way and roll out into a large circle"
- "Cut a wide strip of fondant and line the inner hole then fill with the sweets"
- "Roll out the remaining fondant and lay over the whole cake, smoothing down and cutting off the excess with a sharp knife. Tuck the loose edge in underneath"
- "Use the back of a knife to make the pumpkin skin markings"
- "Use the black piping icing to make the face"
- "Add a mixture of other gel colours to the fondant offcuts to make brown and form into the stalk. Don&#39;t make it too heavy or it&#39;ll tear through the ready roll icing on top"
