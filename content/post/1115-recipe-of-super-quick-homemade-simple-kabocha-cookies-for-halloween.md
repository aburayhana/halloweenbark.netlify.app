- "Microwave kabocha and remove the skin. If you have approximately 40 g, that&#39;s generally fine. Don&#39;t throw away the skin, since you&#39;ll be using a bit of it later on."
- "Preheat your oven to 340°F/170°C. Add sugar and vegetable oil to the bowl with the kabocha and mix. You don&#39;t have to mix it that thoroughly."

- "Press them down a little."
- "Here we&#39;ll use the kabocha skins. Cut them into triangles and stick them in the heads. If you can&#39;t quite stick them in, it&#39;s okay to place them under the dough."
- "Make a smile for the face. I recommend using chopsticks for the eyes and a spoon for the mouth."
- "Once you&#39;ve made your shapes bake in the oven at 340°F/170°C for 15 minutes."
- "And they&#39;re done!"
- "I made pumpkins and smiley faces. For the pumpkins I just use a spoon, no faces. I really like the lines."
- "This cookie is more soft than crunchy. It&#39;s not that sweet, so add more sugar if desired."
