Because the topping is sweet, I&#39;ve reduced the amount of sugar used in this pumpkin pie, so it won&#39;t be cloying. For the crumble, combine pecans, maple syrup, and salt. Once cooled, crush the caramelized pecans in a plastic bag. The filling is a traditional pumpkin pie filling — with all the familiar players of cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg — but instead of using a can of sweetened condensed milk, I use maple syrup to sweeten the pie, and it adds a really nice flavor. Remember the level will raise once the crumble topping is added on.
