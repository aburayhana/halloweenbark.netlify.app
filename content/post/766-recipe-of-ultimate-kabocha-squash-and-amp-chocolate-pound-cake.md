Sweeter than butternut squash, its orange flesh is a cross between pumpkin and sweet potato, and has the texture of roasted chestnuts. It&#39;s also quite similar to acorn squash, but much sweeter, and can be used in any recipe calling for the latter. Kabocha is a hard squash, like most winter squash varieties are, and it has green, slightly bumpy skin, often with light green or white stripes, and dark yellow-orange flesh inside. You&#39;ll find that it&#39;s a very sweet squash and has a slightly dry texture.
