I wanted a moist bar that wasn&#39;t too terribly dense, but also not cakey. The base of the bars is a little more cake-like than brownie-like in that they are less dense. In another medium bowl whisk together oil, eggs and vanilla; stir in apples. Beat in butter just until moistened. Place cookie mix in large bowl.
