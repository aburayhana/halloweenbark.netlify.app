- "Beat the egg and add it to the butter-sugar mixture in 3 batches, mixing and incorporating completely between additions."
- "Sift the dry ingredients. For the white cookies it&#39;s just the cake flour."
- "Mix the flours in using a cut-and-fold motion. Don&#39;t knead the dough."
- "When the dough comes together, take it out of the bowl and wrap it in plastic wrap. Flatten and chill in the refrigerator."
- "Squeeze the dough lightly to even it out. Roll out to a 4mm thickness. Preheat the oven to 340°F/170°C."

- "You can draw pictures or letters too."

- "You can add colorful elements to both the black and white cookies. You can also just write directly on the cookies."
- "You can also draw pictures on plain round or square cookies without using special cookie cutters."
- "If you have very small children they may get scared if the decorations are too creepy, so make them cute. Please use your imagination to make whatever designs you can come up with."
